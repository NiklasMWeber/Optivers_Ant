        "\n",

        "c) Can you write a program that comes up with an estimate of average time to find food for any closed boundary around the anthill? What would be the answer if food is located outside an defined by $( (x – 2.5cm) / 30cm )^2 + ( (y – 2.5cm) / 40cm )^2 < 1$ in coordinate system where the anthill is located at $(x = 0cm, y = 0cm)$?
